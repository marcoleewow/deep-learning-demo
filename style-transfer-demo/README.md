# Style Transfer Demo

The code from this directory is taken from

https://github.com/zhanghang1989/PyTorch-Multi-Style-Transfer

I removed the training args and set the default model to 'models/21styles.model' 
and default run on CPU.

Remember to download the model before running the python script!

```
bash models/download_model.sh

python camera_demo.py
```
